Notes
- There are a few file here that are html assistances.One file will be a screenshot of the file path of where you need to go to modify it. 
- The others will be the actual files with modifications in the form of comments highlighting where to modify it

To summerize:
- The projects file with the HTML code that has been modified to highlight where to modify the files
- The modification template you can use that I tested and proven to work is going to be in its own file
- And a screenshot of the file path you need to use to reach the specific file you need to modify.

When you have the destination for the buttons ready implement the redirect mechansim into your code as highlighted on the modified page with the highlights.
